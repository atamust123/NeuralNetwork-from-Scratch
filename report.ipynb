    "# PART II: Classification of Natural Scenes using Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many model was created with different hyperparameters. They are stored in pickle files. The code in here used them. Only one Neural Network code is implemented for three types of NN(single layer, 1 hidden layer and 2 hidden layer).\n",
    "\n",
    "## About dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Data has read one by one, resized 30x30 after that Normalization ((X-x_min)/(x_max-x_min)) was applied. Finally it was converted to 900,1 vector.\n",
    "    - Train set contains [vector,label] vector has 900,1 feature dimension.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## About Neural Network:\n",
    "- My code default initializes with single layer neural network. Default weight and bias parameters are created with random small values. Then there are 3 backpropagation parameters are defined.(activation_outputs, derivation_outputs, bias_deltas) \n",
    "- There are two activation functions were used (tanh and sigmoid), and sigmoid gives better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In general my code above does not give good results.(All three types of network gives around 30% - 40% accuracy.) Even though normalization and avoiding overflow and underflow results are not very good. Nevertheless my network is learning.\n",
    "- About 1 hidden layer neural network: If it contains 100 node in hidden layer it gives 43.8% accuracy. Of course, when the number of nodes are increased, the accuracy also increases. but it does not worth the cost spent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About forward propagation:\n",
    "    - First activation output is input, it is stored for backpropagation to update the weights and bias. Each time we calculate the next layers input and take its activation output. At the end we returned the softmax function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## About back propagation:\n",
    "     - The main objective of the project is here. It is important to update all the weights and bias values is cumbersome and took my whole week. When we calculate mini batch error we update the whole weights by derivative of the activation function. In my code activation-outputs are explained in forward.\n",
    "     - After that we update the weights and bias values by the calculated derivation outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About activation functions:\n",
    " - I firstly wanted to use ReLu, and I already implement it. But it does not converge and i searched for it. In many explanation it is accepted that ReLu is better than both sigmoid and tanh, but it is only one side. For the negative side it is the worst. Some called this dying ReLu.\n",
    " - I chose sigmoid and tanh activation functions. Sigmoid gives slightly better results when I chose small batch size(2,4), when I chose large batch size such as 128 sigmoid and tanh gave me the same accuracy and loss. After each foward propagation I returned softmax.\n",

    " - Cross entropy(negative log likelihood) was used as loss funciton. Sum of squared used but it does not gives me accurate results and i removed them. Only cross entropy loss will be shown.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - Smaller learning rate such as 0.01 with decay rate 0.99 gives better results than others. It ıs because of oscillation. Learning rate is decresed after each epoch.\n",
    "  - The main criteria of improving the results is that when the batch size is 1 or near to 1 it gives the highest accuracy. But in the plotting I will show the high batch size. (Because I have no time and other lectures have also projects)\n",

    "### Finally:\n",
    "- The results are really bad. But it can be optimized with changing hyperparameters. Choosing different loss function and using softmax did not change result so much.
